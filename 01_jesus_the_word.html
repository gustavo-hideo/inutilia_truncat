    The scriptures make mention of Christ as “The Word” several times. What does that mean?

    Pres. Russell M. Nelson taught the following:
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <i>“In the Greek language of the New Testament, that Word was Logos, or ‘expression.’ It was another name for the Master. 
        That terminology may seem strange, but it is appropriate. We use words to convey our expression to others. 
        So Jesus was the Word, or expression, of His Father to the world“</i>
        (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2000/04/jesus-the-christ-our-master-and-more?lang=eng&para=p6#p6" target="_blank">
        Ensign April 2000</a>)
</p>
<p><span id="space"></span> 
    Adding to Pres. Nelson’s teachings, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng" target="_blank">D&C 93:8</a> 
    gives us more details on the title of “Word”:
    <i>“In the beginning the Word was, for he was the Word, even the messenger of salvation”</i>. Christ is the messenger of the Father to the world.
    He declares the Father’s words.
</p>
<br>
<p><span id="space"></span> 
    The translation of Joseph Smith of <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/jst/jst-john/1?lang=eng" target="_blank">John 1:1</a>
    makes it more clear: <i>“In the beginning was the gospel preached through the Son. And the gospel was the word, and the word was with the Son, and 
    the Son was with God, and the Son was of God.”</i>
</p>
<br>
<p><span id="space"></span> 
    I like how it’s written “<i>through</i> the Son” instead of “by the Son”. The gospel was preached through the Son, and the gospel was the word.
    The gospel, or Jesus Christ, is the <i>expression</i> of God to the world.

    In Lehi’s dream, the iron rod, which led through mists of darkness, was explained by Nephi as “the word of God”. The promise followed
    (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15?lang=eng" target="_blank">I Nephi 15:24</a>):
    <i>“whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and 
        the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction”</i>.

    Talking about the scriptures, Pres. Ezra Taft Benson taught:
    <br>
    <i>[...] In the word of God and <strong>through</strong> it, we can find the power to resist temptation, the power to thwart the work of 
        Satan and his emissaries</i>
